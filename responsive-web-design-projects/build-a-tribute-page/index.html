      <h2>Timeline of Vitka's Life</h2>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1920</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>March 14</strong> - Vitka is born in Kalisz (Kalisch), Poland.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1939</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>September</strong> - Germans invade Poland. Vitka flees with her brother. She leaves him with their grandparents and goes to Vilna, Lithuania.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1940</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>June</strong> - Germans invade Vilna and force over 20,000 (exact number is disputed widely) Jews into a tiny ghetto.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>End of 1940 - 1941</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At some point in this timeframe, Vitka met Ruzka Korczak, whom she would befriend. Together they joined <em>Ha-Shomer Ha-Tsa'ir</em>, a Zionist youth group led by Abba Kovner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>December</strong> - Abba and Jacob Gens (the camp leader) learn from a survivor that Jews that are taken "East" are getting killed in pits. Jacob doesn't believe the survivor and thinks they are crazy. He and the Jewish police decide no one should hear the survivor's story.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>December 31</strong> - Abba delivers a now-famous speech to Ha-Shomer Ha-Tsa'ir (this is the speech that uses the famous phrase, "We will not be led like sheep to the slaughter"). Ha-Shomer Ha-Tsa'ir begins organizing a resistance. Vitka begins searching for places to retaliate agaisnt the Germans.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1942</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>January 21</strong> - <em>United Partisan Organization</em> (UPO, a.k.a. <em>Fareynigte Partizaner Organizatsye</em>, FPO) was founded as an organized resistance effort by Vitka, Abba, and others.
          </li>
          <li>
            June 8 - Vitka and a group of the resistance blow up a German train, thought to be one of the first acts of sabotage in occupied Europe.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1943</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>July</strong> - Gens betrays FPO by surrendering their commander Yitzhak Wittenberg to the Germans. The resistance rescued Wittenberg, but the Germans told the Jews that if they didn't give him back, they would kill every Jew. This led to a full day of fighting amongst the Jews while Vitka hid Wittenberg. In the end Wittenberg was handed over and he committed suicide in jail.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A few weeks later</strong> - The resistance began abandoning the ghetto to fight in the woods. Vitka would escort them out in waves. She'd take them to a Jewish cemetery first where she'd buried weapons previously so they could dig them up and use them when
            they were fleeing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before they could all escape, the Nazis launched a raid and rounded up thousands to send to work camps. Resistance groups got ready for battle and reported to two locations while they awaited weapons.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>September 1</strong> - Gens betrayed one of the resistance's meeting points, which led to many of them going down fighting. Vitka and Ruzka almost died in the fighting but managed to escape through the sewers with a small group of survivors.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>September 1943 - 1944</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The remnants of the resistance lived in the forest alongside other rebel groups of Russians and Lithuanians. The other rebel groups were better off since they got reinforcements and help from locals, but everyone looked down on the Jewish resistance, and would at times even assualt them.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Jewish resistance formed into <em>Ha-Nokmim</em>, which translates to <em>"The Avengers"</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitka became commander of a patrol group that collected information, maintened contact with the underground in Vilna, transferred medications, led combat missions, and performed acts of sabotage. She also led groups of Jewish fighters to the forest camp until they numbered six hundred.
          </li>
          <li>
            During this time, Vitka and Abba began their personal relationship.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitka led an attack on the Vilna electric grid while another group attacked the sewers. When they finished, they met up. Part of the group wanted to sleep in the city, but Kempner and others decided to leave. Those that stayed behind, were caught.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Jewish partisans had to resort to raiding local peasantry to get enough food and supplies. Through it all, Vitka refused to take for her own well-being. The Russians would laugh at her and say she was not a human being, since she seemed to not need food or sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>June/July</strong> - Vitka led a patrol unit to help Jewish Soviet solders to take back Vilna. She was awarded the highest badge of courage in the USSR. Many others in the group, including Ruzka, also earned medals, which afforded them some mobility in the now-Russian occupied Vilna.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1945</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Soviet secret police began arresting dissidents, which included Abba's and Vitka's group. They decided to send Ruzka to British Palestine to gain support for an exodus of Jews from Europe to Palestine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Passover</strong> - Abba forms a new group with Vitka called <em>Nakam</em>, which means revenge. Its members felt they had no right to move on with their lives and that those responsible for the Holocaust should suffer. They did not believe there would be justice in international courts. They planned to poison the waterworks of some of the most important cities to the Nazis, indiscriminately killing millions of Germans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abba had Ruzka introduce him to people who could help with their efforts in seeking revenge, under the pretense of "justice". He did not usually state their goal as the mass killings, and rather as more targeted attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="time-card">
        <h3>1946</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abba was arrested on his way back to Europe and sent one last letter to Vitka telling her to enact plan B: poisoning Nazi POWs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>April 13</strong> - Nakam inflitrated a bakery supplying bread for POWs at Nuremberg. They poisoned ~2300 loaves with arsenic before they had to escape. According to news reports, thousands fell ill, but none died.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>July</strong> - Abba, Ruzka, and Vitka re-unite in Palestine, along with the Nakam members. The group enaged in arguments about ending their operations and starting a new life. Abba, Ruzka, and Vitka all wanted the war to end and to start anew.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitka and Abba settle down. Ruzka ends up living 20 yards away.

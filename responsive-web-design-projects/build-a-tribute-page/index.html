          At some point in this time-frame, Vitka met Rozka Korczak, whom she would befriend. Together
          they joined <em>Ha-Shomer Ha-Tsa'ir</em>, a Zionist youth group led by Abba Kovner.

          Abba and Jacob Gens (the camp leader) learn from a survivor that Jews that are taken "East" are getting
          killed in pits. Jacob doesn't believe the survivor and thinks they are crazy. He and the Jewish police decide
          no one should hear the survivor's story.

          Abba delivers a now-famous speech to Ha-Shomer Ha-Tsa'ir (this is the speech that uses the famous phrase,
          "We will not be led like sheep to the slaughter"). Ha-Shomer Ha-Tsa'ir begins organizing a resistance.
          Vitka begins searching for places to retaliate against the Germans.

        <p>
          <em>United Partisan Organization</em> (UPO, a.k.a. <em>Fareynigte Partizaner Organizatsye</em>, FPO) was
          founded as an organized resistance effort by Vitka, Abba, and others.

          Vitka and a group of the resistance blow up a German train, thought to be one of the first acts of sabotage in
          occupied Europe.

        <p>
          Gens betrays FPO by surrendering their commander Yitzhak Wittenberg to the Germans. The resistance rescued
          Wittenberg, but the Germans told the Jews that if they didn't give him back, they would kill every Jew.
          This led to a full day of fighting amongst the Jews while Vitka hid Wittenberg. In the end Wittenberg was
          handed over and he committed suicide in jail.

        <p>
          The resistance began abandoning the ghetto to fight in the woods. Vitka would escort them out in waves.
          She'd take them to a Jewish cemetery first where she'd buried weapons previously so they could dig them up
          and use them when they were fleeing.

          Before they could all escape, the Nazis launched a raid and rounded up thousands to send to work camps.
          Resistance groups got ready for battle and reported to two locations while they awaited weapons.

          Gens betrayed one of the resistance's meeting points, which led to many of them going down fighting. Vitka
          and Rozka almost died in the fighting but managed to escape through the sewers with a small group of
          survivors.

        <h3 class="font-medium text-tertiary">September 1943 - June 1944</h3>
        <p>Many things happened in this time period including:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            The Jewish resistance formed into <em>Ha-Nokmim</em>, which translates to <em>"The Avengers"</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitka became commander of a patrol group that collected information, maintained contact with the underground
            in Vilna, transferred medications, led combat missions, and performed acts of sabotage. She also led groups
            of
            Jewish fighters to the forest camp until they numbered six hundred.
          </li>
          <li>
            During this time, Vitka and Abba began their personal relationship.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitka led an attack on the Vilna electric grid while another group attacked the sewers. When they finished,
            they met up. Part of the group wanted to sleep in the city, but Kempner and others decided to leave. Those
            that stayed behind, were caught.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Jewish partisans had to resort to raiding local peasantry to get enough food and supplies. Through it
            all,
            Vitka refused to take for her own well-being. The Russians would laugh at her and say she was not a human
            being, since she seemed to not need food or sleep.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="1944-july" class="time-card">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-tertiary">July 1944</h3>
        <p>
          Vitka led a patrol unit to help Jewish Soviet solders to take back Vilna. She was awarded the highest badge of
          courage in the USSR. Many others in the group, including Rozka, also earned medals, which afforded them some
          mobility in the now-Russian occupied Vilna.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="1945-january" class="time-card">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-tertiary">January 1945</h3>
        <p>
          The Soviet secret police began arresting dissidents, which included Abba's and Vitka's group. They decided to
          send Rozka to British Palestine to gain support for an exodus of Jews from Europe to Palestine.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="1945-passover" class="time-card">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-tertiary">Passover 1945</h3>
        <p>
          Abba forms a new group with Vitka called <em>Nakam</em>, which means revenge. Its members felt they had no
          right to move on with their lives and that those responsible for the Holocaust should suffer. They did not
          believe there would be justice in international courts. They planned to poison the waterworks of some of the
          most important cities to the Nazis, indiscriminately killing millions of Germans.
        </p>

      <div id="1945-fall" class="time-card">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-tertiary">Fall 1945</h3>
        <p>
          Abba had Rozka introduce him to people who could help with their efforts in seeking revenge, under the
          pretense of "justice". He did not usually state their goal as the mass killings, and rather as more targeted
          attacks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="1946-january" class="time-card">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-tertiary">January 1946</h3>
        <p>
          Abba was arrested on his way back to Europe and sent one last letter to Vitka telling her to enact plan B:
          poisoning Nazi POWs.

        <p>
          Nakam infiltrated a bakery supplying bread for POWs at Nuremberg. They poisoned ~2300 loaves with arsenic
          before they had to escape. According to news reports, thousands fell ill, but none died.

        <p>
          Abba, Rozka, and Vitka re-unite in Palestine, along with the Nakam members. The group engaged in arguments
          about ending their operations and starting a new life. Abba, Rozka, and Vitka all wanted the war to end and to
          start anew.

          Vitka contracted tuberculosis. Her enforced distance from Michael caused her a lot of suffering during this
          time. To cope, Vitka began taking university courses via correspondence. She studied history, English, and
          French.

          Vitka gave birth to her second child, Shlomit. Due to her previous bout with tuberculosis, she was prohibited
          from most forms of contact with Shlomit, which caused more suffering for Vitka.

          Vitka began studying clinical psychology full time. Var Ilan University let her complete her studies for both
          her first and second degrees within 3 years. While studying, Vitka developed a new form of therapy,
          "Non-verbal therapy by color." It proved very successful in the Unit for Parent-Child Treatment at Oranim
          Teachers' College.

          Throughout this time, Vitka's heroism and struggles throughout the partisan movement became more common
